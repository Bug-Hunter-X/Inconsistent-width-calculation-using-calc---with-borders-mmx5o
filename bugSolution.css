The solution is to adjust the `calc()` expression to include the border width:

```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 20px - 20px); /* Subtract border width from both sides */
  border: 10px solid black;
}
```

By subtracting the total border width (20px in this case, 10px on each side) from the calculation, the width is accurately computed and rendered consistently across browsers.

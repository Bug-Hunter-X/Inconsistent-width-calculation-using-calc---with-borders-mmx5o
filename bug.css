The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  border: 10px solid black;
}
```

The `calc()` function is used to calculate the width of the div. However, some browsers might misinterpret the calculation when the border is added, resulting in incorrect rendering.
